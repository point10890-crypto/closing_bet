### 🤖 AI Analysis

Okay, here's a summary of the September 2023 crypto market data you provided, with some likely influencing events:

*   **Bitcoin showed positive growth, slightly outperforming Ethereum:** BTC's +3.32% suggests a preference for Bitcoin. The negative ETH/BTC ratio (-2.33%) supports this, showing BTC gained ground against ETH.
*   **Altcoin performance was mixed with pockets of strength:** LINK's impressive +32.4% gain indicates project-specific positive news or developments around Chainlink, whereas other alts showed varied, less impressive performance.
*   **Market movements suggest a risk-off or selective-risk sentiment:** With BTC outperforming ETH, and uncorrelated price action to the S&P 500 (SPY) and Gold, investors were likely waiting on macro clarity/policy changes rather than investing in crypto.
*   **Possible Key Event Influence - ETF Hopes & Regulatory Uncertainty:** September 2023 was likely influenced by continued speculation around Bitcoin ETF approvals, which often drives BTC price. Regulatory headwinds may have also played a dampening effect on alts.
*   **Dominance Trends: Bitcoin Dominance:** The relative outperformance of Bitcoin and the negative ETH/BTC ratio suggest a shift towards Bitcoin dominance during this period. A true alt season did not seem to take hold.
