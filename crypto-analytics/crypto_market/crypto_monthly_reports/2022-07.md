### 🤖 AI Analysis

Here's a summary of the crypto market activity in July 2022 based on the data provided:

*   **Strong Recovery & "Summer Relief":** Both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced significant positive price movement, suggesting a rebound after the prolonged bearish market conditions of the preceding months, especially for Ethereum.
*   **Ethereum Outperformance:** The substantial increase in the ETH/BTC ratio indicates Ethereum significantly outperformed Bitcoin, fueled by anticipation surrounding the upcoming Merge.
*   **Altcoin Rally Led by MATIC:** Several altcoins delivered impressive gains, with Polygon (MATIC) leading the pack, indicating a potential shift toward higher-risk assets amidst improved sentiment, and alt-coins outperforming BTC due to this market sentiment.
*   **Correlations Remain Neutral:** Bitcoin's zero correlation with the S&P 500 and gold suggests it was trading independently of traditional markets, possibly influenced more by internal crypto-specific factors and speculative activity.
*   **Key Events driving movement:** The most significant driver was the increasing anticipation and positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum's upcoming Merge from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. This fueled Ethereum's price surge and spilled over into positive performance for other altcoins. There were no notable halvings, ETF news, hacks, or significant protocol upgrades apart from Merge expectations during this period. The market was trending towards an Alt Season driven by the Ethereum narrative.
