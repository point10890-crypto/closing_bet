### 🤖 AI Analysis

Okay, here's an analysis of the provided crypto market data for April 2022:

*   **Overall Market Weakness:** Both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced negative returns in April, indicating a generally risk-off sentiment prevailing in the market. Bitcoin notably dropped almost 13%.
*   **Ethereum Outperformance vs. Bitcoin:** Despite ETH also dropping, the positive change in the ETH/BTC ratio suggests Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin during the month, implying increased relative demand for ETH.
*   **Mixed Altcoin Performance:** Altcoin performance was diverse, with some, like UNI, showing substantial gains, while others, like AAVE, SOL and BNB, experienced losses. This suggests a more selective market rather than a broad "alt season".
*   **No Correlation with Traditional Assets:** The zero correlations between Bitcoin and both the S&P 500 (SPY) and gold indicate that Bitcoin was not acting as either a risk-on or safe-haven asset during this period.

## Key Events and Drivers (April 2022):

*   **Key Event(s):** The leadup to the Ethereum Merge was gathering steam. Also, the broader market was digesting increasing interest rates and inflation fears.
*   **Market Drivers:** Macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from rising inflation and anticipated interest rate hikes likely dampened investor enthusiasm, pushing them toward safer assets (away from crypto in general) and causing the market dips in BTC and ETH.
*   **Alt Season/BTC Dominance:** The gains of UNI and general outperformance of ETH vs. BTC, indicate the start of a *mini* alt-season (or more likely increased bullishness towards ETH). However, the declines in Bitcoin and Ethereum suggest that overall investor sentiment and/or the external environment was a larger influence.
