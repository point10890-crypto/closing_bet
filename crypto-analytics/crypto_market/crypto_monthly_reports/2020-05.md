### 🤖 AI Analysis

Here's a brief analysis of the crypto market data for May 2020:

*   **Bitcoin & Ethereum Rally:** Both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced significant gains (around 28%) indicating a strong positive market sentiment overall. Bitcoin approached the psychologically important $10,000 level.

*   **Altcoin Performance Varies:** While some altcoins like ADA and MATIC saw explosive growth, others lagged behind (UNI, although not listed here with a return, was the worst performing alt). This suggests a selective "alt season" where specific narratives drove performance rather than a broad altcoin surge.

*   **BTC Halving Event:** The Bitcoin halving occurred on May 11th, reducing the block reward for miners. This event likely contributed to the positive BTC price movement as supply decreased and the expectation of future scarcity grew.

*   **Low Correlation to Traditional Assets:** BTC showed virtually no correlation to both SPY (S&P 500) and Gold. This highlights its continued role as an independent asset class, at least during this specific period.

*   **BTC Dominance Stays Flat:** With ETH/BTC ratio relatively flat, it would suggest Bitcoin's dominance remained relatively stable during May.
