### 🤖 AI Analysis

Here's a breakdown of the crypto market activity for 2025-04, based on the provided data and general knowledge:

*   **Bitcoin Outperforms, Ethereum Suffers:** Bitcoin saw a solid gain while Ethereum significantly declined, and top altcoins generally struggled or remained stagnant, pointing to BTC dominance. The ETH/BTC ratio plummeted.
*   **ETF Optimism Fuels BTC:** News surrounding further institutional adoption of Bitcoin, likely additional positive ETF approvals or inflows in anticipation of a large institutional player entering the space, drove BTC demand, with limited spillover to altcoins.
*   **Zero Correlation with Traditional Assets:** Bitcoin maintained a near-zero correlation with both the S&P 500 and Gold, reinforcing its narrative as an independent asset class, although not necessarily a hedge against traditional markets in this period.
*   **Dominance Trend:** Altcoins, outside of SOL, were underperforming, so this would point to BTC dominance over alts during April 2025.
