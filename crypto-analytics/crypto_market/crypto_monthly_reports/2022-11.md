### 🤖 AI Analysis

Okay, here's a brief analysis of the crypto market data provided for November 2022:

*   **Downturn Driven by FTX Collapse:** The significant price drops in Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside the 'Worst Alt' being SOL, heavily suggest the FTX collapse as the primary driver of the market's negative performance in November 2022. The correlation of 0 for BTC with both SPY and Gold indicates a downturn specific to Crypto, not a wider macro economic trend.

*   **Altcoins Show Mixed Performance Amidst Chaos:** While Bitcoin and Ethereum declined sharply, a few altcoins, notably DOGE and LTC, experienced substantial gains. DOGE was likely pumped due to Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, and LTC likely was pumped as a result of this pump and dump cycle. This hints at specific narratives and potential market manipulation dominating altcoin movements in the face of broader uncertainty.

*   **ETH/BTC Ratio Suggests Relative Ethereum Strength:** The positive change in the ETH/BTC ratio despite both assets declining indicates Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin relatively during the month. This is a trend that continued as the Merge hype from earlier in the year continued to settle.
