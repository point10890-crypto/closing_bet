*   **Strong market uptrend:** Both Bitcoin (+9.73%) and Ethereum (+13.57%) experienced significant gains, with altcoins generally outperforming BTC, as demonstrated by the positive ETH/BTC ratio change (+3.50%).
*   **Altcoin Season Ignition:** Several altcoins, especially UNI (+554.6%), AVAX (+100.6%), and SOL (+82.5%) saw explosive growth, suggesting the possible beginning of "alt season" sentiment. Litecoin was the worst performer.
*   **ETF Anticipation:** The primary market mover was growing anticipation and speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC, driving both BTC and the wider crypto market upward.
*   **Low Traditional Market Correlation:** BTC demonstrated zero correlation with the S&P 500 (SPY) and gold, suggesting crypto moved independently of traditional markets during this period.
*   **Key Crypto Event:** Binance settled with the US Department of Justice, with Changpeng Zhao stepping down as CEO. However, this news did not have a material negative effect on the crypto prices, with the positive ETF news overshadowing it.
