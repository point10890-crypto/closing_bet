### 🤖 AI Analysis

Here's a summary of the crypto market performance in August 2023 based on the data provided:

*   **August saw a broad market downturn:** Both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced negative performance, with altcoins generally underperforming even further, as indicated by negative returns for the top altcoins.
*   **ETH underperformed BTC:** The negative ETH/BTC ratio change signals Bitcoin outperformed Ethereum, suggesting a shift towards BTC dominance, or less risk appetite.
*   **Correlations weakened:** Near-zero correlations between Bitcoin and traditional assets (SPY, Gold) suggest crypto moved independently of broader macroeconomic trends, likely driven by crypto-specific news.
*   **Key Events & Market Sentiment:** The market decline in August 2023 was largely attributed to increasing fears of rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainties, exacerbated by the SEC's continued delays and rejections of spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The lack of positive catalysts, such as a major protocol upgrade or a clear path to ETF approval, further contributed to the negative sentiment. The approval of Grayscale's appeal of the SEC's rejection of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) application to convert into an ETF occurred at the tail end of August, and did not reverse market trends during the month.
*   **No Alt Season:** The underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, combined with the ETH/BTC ratio decline, suggests August was not an alt season. BTC dominance was either sustained or strengthened during this period.
