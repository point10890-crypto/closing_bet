### 🤖 AI Analysis

Here's a brief summary of the crypto market analysis for May 2024 based on the provided data:

*   **Positive Market Performance:** Bitcoin and Ethereum both experienced positive gains, with Ethereum significantly outperforming Bitcoin, as indicated by the ETH/BTC ratio increase. Several top altcoins also saw substantial price increases.
*   **Possible Alt Season Signals:** The strong performance of Ethereum and select altcoins like LINK, AAVE, and SOL suggests a potential shift toward altcoin dominance within the crypto market, though there was high variance among the top alts.

1.  **Key Crypto Events:**
    *   **Ethereum ETF Approval Anticipation:** The market heavily anticipated potential spot Ethereum ETF approvals in the US.

    *   **Risk-On Sentiment:** Despite macro uncertainty, some investors adopted a risk-on approach, contributing to the gains in select altcoins, seeking higher returns beyond Bitcoin's established growth.

3.  **Alt Season/BTC Dominance Trends:**
    *   **Signs of Alt Season:** The outperformance of ETH and certain altcoins compared to Bitcoin signals the beginning phases of an alt season, with investors diversifying into higher-risk, higher-reward assets.
