### 🤖 AI Analysis

Okay, here's a breakdown of the crypto market data for June 2023, based on the information provided and my knowledge as a crypto market analyst:

*   **Bitcoin's Dominance Returns:** Bitcoin significantly outperformed Ethereum (+14.99% vs. +2.56%), with the ETH/BTC ratio dropping significantly, indicating a shift towards Bitcoin dominance. This can be attributed to increased institutional interest and a flight to relative safety amidst regulatory uncertainty.

*   **Altcoin Performance Highly Varied:** While some altcoins like UNI saw massive gains (+167%), others (AAVE, LTC, DOT) experienced losses, suggesting a selective market. Speculation played a large role in the winners and losers.

*   **Regulatory Clarity Concerns:** Regulatory scrutiny surrounding altcoins contributed to the shift in market sentiment from Alts back to BTC. The SEC had been ramping up enforcement actions against certain altcoins and exchanges which brought significant fear.

*   **Blackrock ETF News Influence:** The filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock was a major catalyst in June. This injected considerable optimism into the market, as it was seen as a sign of institutional acceptance and potential for wider adoption driving up the price of BTC.

*   **Correlations Breakdown:** BTC-SPY and BTC-Gold correlations being at 0, suggests that BTC was more focused on ETF news then traditional market correlations.
