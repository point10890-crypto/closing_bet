### 🤖 AI Analysis

Here's a summary of the crypto market in December 2020 based on the provided data:

*   **Bitcoin's Surge and Dominance:** Bitcoin experienced a substantial price increase (over 50%), indicating strong investor interest and solidifying its position as the market leader. The negative ETH/BTC ratio reinforces BTC's relative outperformance.

*   **Altcoin Performance Mixed:** While some altcoins like LTC and DOT saw significant gains, others lagged behind. The divergence in performance signals a selective altcoin season, not a broad-based rally. XRP was likely impacted negatively by regulatory news.

*   **Institutional Adoption Narrative:** The absence of correlation with traditional assets (SPY and Gold) suggests Bitcoin's rise was driven primarily by factors within the crypto space, likely fueled by growing institutional adoption and narrative, viewing BTC as a hedge against inflation.

*   **Key Event - Increased Institutional Adoption:** Increased institutional involvement from companies like MicroStrategy and Square publicly announcing Bitcoin investments contributed significantly to the bullish sentiment and price surge. As well as PayPal allowing users to buy/sell crypto.

*   **Market Moved Due To:** A combination of institutional interest, limited supply, and growing mainstream awareness drove demand for Bitcoin, pushing its price to new all-time highs. Investor confidence in BTC's long-term viability as a store of value increased.
