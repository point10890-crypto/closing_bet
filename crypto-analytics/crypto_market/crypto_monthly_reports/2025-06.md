### 🤖 AI Analysis

Okay, here's a brief analysis of the crypto market data provided for June 2025, incorporating my understanding of potential key events that could have influenced the market at that time:

*   **Slight Market Correction Despite Optimism:** Bitcoin experienced a slight correction (-0.60%) despite reaching a new all-time high earlier in the month. Ethereum saw a more significant decrease of -1.99% - which caused the ETH/BTC ratio to decline (-1.40%). This suggests investors locking in profits and diversifying into Alt Coins.
*   **AAVE Outperforms Amid DeFi Rebound:** AAVE showed resilience (+3.7%) as one of the best-performing altcoins, while meme coins like DOGE were lagging, possibly signaling renewed interest in DeFi projects and their fundamental value.
*   **Bitcoin Decouples from Traditional Assets:** Zero correlation with SPY and Gold indicates Bitcoin's increasing maturity as an independent asset class, less influenced by traditional market trends.
*   **Potential Trigger: Post-Halving Consolidation & ETF Approval Uncertainty:** The modest decline in Bitcoin could be attributed to a period of consolidation following the 2024 halving as well as regulatory hurdles and delays in approving spot ETFs for other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin and Ethereum in the US.
