### 🤖 AI Analysis

Here's a brief analysis of the crypto market data for September 2021:

*   **September saw a market-wide correction:** Both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced significant price drops, indicating a general cooling off period after a strong summer. Bitcoin experienced a -15.11% drop.
*   **Altcoins displayed mixed performance, hinting at a selective alt-season:** While most major cryptos were down, Solana (SOL), Cosmos (ATOM) and Avalanche (AVAX) showcased impressive gains, indicating increased interest in specific Layer 1 solutions.
*   **ETH/BTC ratio increased suggesting strong ETH performance vs BTC:** This suggested a possible narrative shift towards Ethereum with excitement around the upcoming Altair upgrade.
*   **BTC uncorrelated to SPY and Gold:** BTC showing near 0 correlation with both the S&P500 and Gold suggests traditional market factors were not the primary drivers of its price action in September, and suggests it had its own market factors at play.

**Key Events & Why the Market Moved**

*   **Evergrande Crisis (Indirect impact):** Worries about the Chinese real estate giant Evergrande's potential default created global market uncertainty, contributing to risk-off sentiment that spilled into the crypto space.
*   **Bitcoin ETF anticipation and regulatory scrutiny:** There was speculation around Bitcoin ETFs, but regulatory concerns likely tempered any significant bullish momentum, preventing a strong recovery.
*   **Ethereum continued its transition to Proof-of-Stake:** Ongoing development and anticipation around the eventual merge to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) maintained interest in Ethereum, with successful testnet deployments contributing to the ETH/BTC ratio increase.

**Alt Season or BTC Dominance?**

*   **Selective Alt-Season:** While Bitcoin underperformed, specific altcoins, particularly SOL, ATOM and AVAX, experienced impressive growth. This suggests a rotation of capital towards projects with strong narratives (e.g., scalability, DeFi). Thus, a 'selective' alt season took place rather than a broad shift in market dominance.
