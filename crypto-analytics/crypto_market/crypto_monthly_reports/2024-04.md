### 🤖 AI Analysis

Here's a summary of the crypto market activity in April 2024 based on the provided data:

*   **Market Correction:** April saw a significant correction across the crypto market, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing negative returns. This coincides with general market uncertainty.
*   **BTC Halving:** The Bitcoin halving event occurred in late April, and although historically bullish, the immediate impact was a price decrease potentially due to "buy the rumor, sell the news" behavior and profit-taking.
*   **Altcoin Performance Varied:** While most altcoins underperformed against Bitcoin (reflected in the negative ETH/BTC ratio change and poor performance of coins like UNI, DOGE, and XRP), BNB demonstrated relative strength, suggesting specific positive catalysts for Binance's ecosystem or rotation of capital to the large cap. AVAX was the worst performing alt.
*   **Macroeconomic Influences:** Geopolitical tensions, such as the Iran-Israel conflict, rose during this time. Higher interest rate expectations led to decreased risk appetite for investors.
*   **Low Correlation:** The near-zero correlation between Bitcoin and traditional assets like the S\&P 500 (SPY) and gold suggests Bitcoin traded independently, unaffected by typical macroeconomic conditions at the time, focusing more on halving and crypto-specific narratives.
