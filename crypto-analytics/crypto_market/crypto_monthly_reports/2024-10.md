### 🤖 AI Analysis

Here's a summary of the October 2024 crypto market data, incorporating likely contributing events and analysis:

*   **Bitcoin Surge & ETF Speculation:** Bitcoin experienced a significant rally (+12.5%), likely fueled by growing anticipation of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US, though they were not approved in October 2024.
*   **DOGE Season:** Dogecoin's explosive growth (+53.2%) indicates a surge in meme coin interest and potentially speculative retail investment, pulling focus away from Ethereum.
*   **Ethereum Underperformance:** Ethereum's marginal gain (+0.11%) and a declining ETH/BTC ratio (-11.01%) suggests that investors were focusing on BTC due to possible ETF approvals and memecoins.
*   **Zero Correlation:** The low correlations to SPY and Gold indicate that the market was driven by internal events and factors more specific to crypto rather than broader macro conditions.
