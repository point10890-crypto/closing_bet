### 🤖 AI Analysis

Okay, here's an analysis of the provided crypto market data for July 2021:

*   **Recovery Trend:** Both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced significant positive gains, indicating a recovery from the sharp corrections observed in the prior months. Bitcoin bounced strongly from the sub-$30k level.

*   **Altcoin Outperformance:** Ethereum's stronger performance relative to Bitcoin (as indicated by the rising ETH/BTC ratio) suggests increasing investor interest in altcoins and the DeFi space. AAVE stood out as the best performer.

*   **Decoupling from Traditional Assets:** The near-zero correlations between Bitcoin and both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Gold suggest Bitcoin was trading independently based on internal crypto market dynamics and sentiment, rather than macro forces during this period.

**Key Events & Market Movement Analysis (July 2021):**

*   **Ethereum London Hard Fork Anticipation:** The upcoming London Hard Fork (EIP-1559), scheduled for early August, created positive sentiment around Ethereum and its potential to address high gas fees, driving its price and benefiting related altcoins like AAVE in anticipation of DeFi growth.

*   **Bitcoin Bottom Formation:** After a brutal May and June due to regulatory concerns in China and environmental FUD, Bitcoin found a bottom near $30,000. News flow stabilized, and institutional dip buying likely contributed to the recovery.

*   **Early Stages of Alt Season:** With Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin and several altcoins showing substantial gains (AAVE, ATOM, LINK), the data suggests a possible nascent alt season, where investors were rotating profits into smaller-cap projects with specific catalysts or narratives.
