### 🤖 AI Analysis

Here's a brief analysis of the crypto market data for 2024-06:

*   **Market Downturn with Alt Strength:** The overall crypto market experienced a correction, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing significant percentage declines. However, the ETH/BTC ratio increased, suggesting some relative outperformance by Ethereum versus Bitcoin. Altcoins generally followed BTC's downward trend.

*   **ETF Inflows Slowed, Hawkish Macro Outlook:** June 2024 saw diminished inflows into Bitcoin ETFs compared to previous months. The Fed signaling fewer rate cuts also dampened risk appetite, pushing investors away from speculative assets like crypto.

*   **No Clear Alt Season:** While BNB demonstrated relative strength within the top altcoins, most alts mirrored Bitcoin's decline. This indicates no broad-based "alt season" was occurring, though isolated outperformers existed. The neutral correlation of BTC to both the S&P 500 and Gold suggests that crypto market performance was not directly tied to traditional asset movements during this period.
