# Historical Market Top Analysis

## Overview

Analysis of major market tops through the lens of the 6-component Market Top Detector framework. These historical cases provide calibration data for the scoring system.

## 2000: Dot-Com Bubble Top (March 2000)

### Timeline
- **S&P 500 Peak:** March 24, 2000 (1,527.46)
- **NASDAQ Peak:** March 10, 2000 (5,048.62)
- **Subsequent Decline:** S&P -49%, NASDAQ -78% over 2.5 years

### Component Signals (Estimated Scores)

| Component | Signal Level | Est. Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Distribution Days | Very High | 90-100 | Heavy distribution throughout March 2000 |
| Leading Stocks | Critical | 85-95 | Internet stocks peaked weeks before indices |
| Defensive Rotation | Strong | 70-80 | Value/defensive outperformed for months |
| Breadth | Critical Divergence | 80-90 | Advance/Decline line peaked in April 1998 |
| Index Technical | Breaking Down | 70-80 | NASDAQ broke 50DMA first |
| Sentiment | Extreme | 90-100 | IPO mania, "new paradigm" narrative |

**Estimated Composite: 82-92 (Critical)**

### Key Lesson
Breadth divergence was the earliest signal (nearly 2 YEARS before the top). Distribution days and leading stock breakdown were the final confirmation signals. By the time all 6 components were flashing red, the decline had already begun.

## 2007: Financial Crisis Top (October 2007)

### Timeline
- **S&P 500 Peak:** October 9, 2007 (1,565.15)
- **Subsequent Decline:** -57% over 17 months (March 2009 low)

### Component Signals (Estimated Scores)

| Component | Signal Level | Est. Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Distribution Days | High | 75-85 | Multiple distribution clusters in Sept-Oct 2007 |
| Leading Stocks | High | 70-80 | Homebuilders (ITB) peaked in Feb 2006, financials (XLF) peaked in June 2007 |
| Defensive Rotation | Moderate | 55-65 | Utilities and healthcare outperforming |
| Breadth | Diverging | 60-70 | NYSE advance/decline line peaked July 2007 |
| Index Technical | Weakening | 50-60 | S&P still near highs but internal structure deteriorating |
| Sentiment | Elevated | 55-65 | VIX was very low (sub-12) for extended period in 2006-2007 |

**Estimated Composite: 62-72 (Red Zone)**

### Key Lesson
The 2007 top was a slow-motion process. Leading sector (financials/housing) peaked 12-18 months before the S&P 500. The composite would have been in the "Orange" zone for months before reaching "Red." This top rewarded patience in reducing exposure rather than a single binary call.

## 2018: Q4 Sell-Off (September-December 2018)

### Timeline
- **S&P 500 Peak:** September 20, 2018 (2,930.75)
- **Subsequent Decline:** -20% (correction, not bear market)
- **Recovery:** V-bottom in December 2018, new highs by April 2019

### Component Signals (Estimated Scores)

| Component | Signal Level | Est. Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Distribution Days | Moderate | 55-65 | Distribution accumulated through October |
| Leading Stocks | Moderate | 50-60 | FAANG stocks peaked at different times (FB in July, AMZN in September) |
| Defensive Rotation | Moderate | 45-55 | Utilities outperformed in Q3 |
| Breadth | Mild Divergence | 40-50 | Breadth narrowing but not extreme |
| Index Technical | Weakening | 55-65 | 50DMA crossed below 200DMA in December |
| Sentiment | Mixed | 35-45 | VIX was elevated but not extreme |

**Estimated Composite: 47-57 (Orange Zone)**

### Key Lesson
This was a classic "correction" case (not a bear market). The composite correctly would have been in Orange zone - enough to warrant profit-taking but not full defensive posture. The rapid V-recovery demonstrated why the composite avoids going to "Critical" without extreme readings across multiple components.

## 2022: Fed Tightening Bear Market (January 2022)

### Timeline
- **S&P 500 Peak:** January 3, 2022 (4,796.56)
- **NASDAQ Peak:** November 19, 2021 (16,057.44)
- **Subsequent Decline:** S&P -25%, NASDAQ -33%

### Component Signals (Estimated Scores at January 2022)

| Component | Signal Level | Est. Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Distribution Days | High | 75-90 | Heavy distribution in late December 2021 and early January 2022 |
| Leading Stocks | Critical | 80-90 | ARKK peaked Feb 2021 (11 months early), many growth stocks -50%+ from highs |
| Defensive Rotation | Strong | 65-75 | XLU, XLP outperforming strongly |
| Breadth | Severe Divergence | 70-80 | NASDAQ new highs/new lows diverging sharply |
| Index Technical | Breaking | 60-70 | NASDAQ broke 200DMA, S&P testing key levels |
| Sentiment | Elevated | 50-60 | Margin debt at record highs, crypto speculation |

**Estimated Composite: 68-78 (Red Zone)**

### Key Lesson
ARKK (leading stock proxy) peaked 11 months before S&P 500. This is a textbook Minervini signal - leading stocks deteriorate long before the index. By January 2022, the composite would have been solidly in the Red zone, correctly signaling aggressive profit-taking. The 2022 case validates the "Leading Stock Health" component as an early warning signal.

## Cross-Case Patterns

### What All Tops Had in Common:
1. **Distribution days clustered** (not spread out) in the weeks before the decline
2. **Leading stocks peaked before the index** (by weeks to months)
3. **Breadth diverged** from index price (the rally became increasingly narrow)
4. **Defensive rotation** accelerated as the top formed

### What Varied:
1. **Severity:** Ranged from -20% correction (2018) to -78% NASDAQ crash (2000)
2. **Speed:** 2018 was a fast decline (3 months), 2000-2002 was slow (2.5 years)
3. **Recovery time:** 2018 recovered in 4 months, 2000 took 7 years (NASDAQ)
4. **Breadth divergence timing:** 2000 had 2-year divergence, 2022 had months

### Scoring Calibration:
- **Orange Zone (41-60):** Correction likely (2018-type, -10-20%)
- **Red Zone (61-80):** Major decline likely (2007, 2022-type, -20-35%)
- **Critical (81-100):** Extreme bubble top (2000-type, -40%+)

### Important Caveat:
Historical calibration is imperfect. Each market environment is unique. The composite score should be used as one input into investment decisions, not as a definitive prediction. Markets can remain in "warning" zones for extended periods before actually declining.

## Pattern: Leading Stocks as Early Warning

From the Monty article:
> 弱気相場の初期段階では、特定の主導株が下降トレンドに抵抗するかのように強く、
> 上昇できるという印象を与えます。

This pattern appeared in every historical top:
- **2000:** Blue-chip tech (MSFT, INTC) held up while dot-coms crashed
- **2007:** Energy sector rallied while financials imploded
- **2022:** AAPL, MSFT relatively stable while ARKK stocks crashed
- **Current analog:** Some mega-caps hold while growth/speculative names deteriorate

This is why Component 2 (Leading Stock Health) uses a broad basket of growth ETFs rather than just the S&P 500 components - it captures the deterioration that indices mask.
