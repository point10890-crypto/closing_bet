# Distribution Day Guide

## What is a Distribution Day?

A Distribution Day occurs when a major stock index (S&P 500 or NASDAQ Composite) declines by 0.2% or more on volume that is higher than the previous trading day. This pattern indicates institutional investors are selling stocks in volume - "distributing" their holdings.

William O'Neil introduced this concept in "How to Make Money in Stocks" as one of the most reliable signals that a market uptrend is under pressure.

## Precise Rules

### Distribution Day Criteria (BOTH must be met):
1. **Price decline >= 0.2%** from previous session's close
2. **Volume > previous day's volume** (even slightly higher counts)

### Stalling Day Criteria (BOTH must be met):
1. **Volume > previous day's volume** (institutional activity present)
2. **Price gain < 0.1%** (price fails to advance meaningfully despite volume)
3. Stalling days count as **0.5 distribution days** in the effective count

### 25-Day Expiration Rule:
- A distribution day automatically expires after **25 trading days** (approximately 5 weeks)
- Only the rolling 25-day window matters
- This prevents old distribution from affecting current assessment

### What Does NOT Count as Distribution:
- Index declines on lower volume (normal profit-taking)
- Large gap-up open followed by slight closing decline (still net positive day)
- Volume below average (lack of institutional participation)

## Counting and Interpretation

| Effective Count | Interpretation | Action |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| 0-1 | Healthy market | Normal operations |
| 2-3 | Some selling but normal | Monitor closely |
| 4 | O'Neil's initial warning | Tighten stops |
| 5 | Significant distribution | Reduce exposure |
| 6+ | Heavy distribution | Protect capital aggressively |

**Effective Count Formula:**
```
Effective Count = Distribution Days + (0.5 × Stalling Days)
```

## Dual-Index Approach

This tool monitors both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ (via QQQ). The higher effective count between the two indices is used for scoring, because:

1. Distribution can concentrate in one index before the other
2. NASDAQ often leads due to higher growth stock concentration
3. The worst signal from either index is the most conservative approach

## Common Patterns at Market Tops

### Classic Distribution Sequence (2022 Example):
1. Week 1: One distribution day (seems harmless)
2. Week 2: Two more distribution days
3. Week 3: One stalling day (selling into rallies)
4. Week 4: Two more distribution days (total: 5-6 effective)
5. Market breaks down shortly after

### False Alarm Pattern:
1. Two distribution days in quick succession
2. Market rallies strongly, erasing concerns
3. Distribution days expire without reaching critical mass
4. Uptrend continues

### Key Distinction:
The **clustering** of distribution days matters. Three distribution days in one week is more alarming than three spread over five weeks.

## Follow-Through Day (FTD)

The FTD is the counterpart to distribution days - it signals a potential new uptrend after a correction.

### FTD Rules:
1. **Rally Attempt:** Market makes its low and begins to rally (first up day)
2. **Counting:** Start counting from day 1 of the rally attempt
3. **FTD Occurs on Day 4-7:** A significant price gain (>1.5%) with volume higher than the previous day
4. **Confirmation:** The FTD should be on day 4 at the earliest (premature rallies on days 1-3 are unreliable)

### FTD Reliability:
- Not all FTDs lead to sustained uptrends (~25% fail)
- Multiple FTDs within a short period increase confidence
- FTDs work best when combined with improving breadth
- O'Neil: "I never try to buy at the bottom. I wait for the Follow-Through Day."

## Practical Tips

### When Monitoring Distribution:
1. Check distribution count DAILY during uncertain markets
2. Pay special attention when count reaches 3 (pre-warning)
3. At 4+, begin defensive actions regardless of other signals
4. Don't wait for 6+ to act - by then, significant damage may be done

### Common Mistakes:
1. **Ignoring stalling days:** They're subtle but significant
2. **Resetting count manually:** Trust the 25-day expiration rule
3. **Using wrong volume data:** Must compare day-to-day, not vs average
4. **Mixing indices:** Count separately for S&P 500 and NASDAQ
5. **Ignoring context:** 4 distribution days in a strong uptrend is different from 4 in a range-bound market
